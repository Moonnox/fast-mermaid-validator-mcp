GENERAL MERMAID SYNTAX RULES:

NODE IDENTIFIERS:
- Must start with a letter (A-Z, a-z)
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores only
- Cannot contain spaces, hyphens, periods, or special characters
- Are case-sensitive (A and a are different)
- Examples: A, Node1, Process_2, START

TEXT CONTENT:
- Always use quotes for text with spaces or special characters
- Use ["text"] format for complex strings
- Escape quotes inside text with backslash
- Use <br/> for line breaks, never literal breaks
- Support HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp;

CONNECTIONS:
- Use standard arrow syntax for connections
- Label decision branches clearly
- Ensure all nodes are properly connected
- No orphaned or unreachable nodes

COMMON FIXES:
- Replace invalid characters in node IDs with underscores
- Quote all text containing spaces or special characters
- Replace \n or literal line breaks with <br/> tags
- Fix malformed arrow and connection syntax
